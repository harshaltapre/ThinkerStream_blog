Build out the basic structure and theme for the blogging platform
ThinkSpeak Blogging Website

You are required to develop a full-stack blogging platform named ThinkSpeak, with the following features:

👉 The website should have an interactive and modern frontend using React.js to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

👉 The website must include an admin dashboard where the administrator can:

log in securely

add, edit, and delete blog posts

manage categories and tags

manage user comments

view blog statistics or simple analytics

👉 All blog content should be dynamic and manageable through the admin panel so that no hard-coded data exists on the frontend.

👉 The backend should be developed using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database to store posts, categories, comments, and user details.

👉 Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization to secure admin routes.

👉 Email notification functionality (using SMTP) should be included to notify the admin when new comments are posted or a user registers.

👉 The website should have a clean, user-friendly, and responsive design, ensuring it works across different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

📧 Email Notification (SMTP Integration)

    Trigger email to admin when:

        New comment is submitted (with content preview)

        A user registers (if extended to allow user logins)

    Use Nodemailer for SMTP configuration

    Email template should be clean, with company branding
